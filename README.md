# Ergodox Ez Eulegang

my [ergodox-ez keyboard config](https://ergodox-ez.com/)


# Workflow

this might be out of the ordinary

follow the setup in the [firmware repo](https://github.com/zsa/qmk_firmware)

and symlink this repo in at `keyboards/ergodox_ez/keymaps/eulegang`

run `make ergodox_ez:eulegang:flash` and hit the hardware reset button on the keyboard to flash on to the ergodox ez keyboard

or run `make ergodox_ez:eulegang` in the firmware and inspect the blob, if you're into that.
